Hacker News is extremely popular in technology and startup circles, and posts that make it to the top of Hacker News' listings can get hundreds of thousands of visitors as a result.\n",
    "\n",
    "I'm specifically interested in posts whose titles begin with either **Ask HN** or **Show HN**. Users submit Ask HN posts to ask the Hacker News community a specific question; users submit Show HN posts to show the Hacker News community a project, product, or just generally something interesting.\n",
