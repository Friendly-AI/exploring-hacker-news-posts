    "\n",
    "Hacker News is a site started by the startup incubator [Y Combinator](https://www.ycombinator.com/), where user-submitted stories (known as \"posts\") are voted and commented upon, similar to reddit. Hacker News is extremely popular in technology and startup circles, and posts that make it to the top of Hacker News' listings can get hundreds of thousands of visitors as a result.\n",
    "\n",
    "I'm specifically interested in posts whose titles begin with either **Ask HN** or **Show HN**. Users submit Ask HN posts to ask the Hacker News community a specific question; Users submit Show HN posts to show the Hacker News community a project, product, or just generally something interesting.\n",

In addition, when I use this function, I'll have the option to output the number of rows and columns in the data set. After I define this function, I'll print the columns (header row) of the data set to understand what each data point represents. Lastly, I'll use the function to investigate a small selection of the data."
